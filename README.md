# Chip-8 virtual machine

Here is my [chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) 
interpreter written with c for fun using [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage) 
for handling anything graphics, audio, and user input related. 
The gui was made using [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) 
which is a immediate mode gui library for c.

I started this project because I wanted to write an emulator for the NES but as someone
with little knowledge of emulators I found that it would be more reasonable for me to start with
something a bit more simpler like the chip-8. Of course the NES is much much more complicated
compared to the chip-8 which is a challenge I look forward to now that I am finished with chip-8.
